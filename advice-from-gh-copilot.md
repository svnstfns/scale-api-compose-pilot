Task List for scale-api-compose-pilot Refactor and Packaging

1. Refactor Project File Structure

Move all core Python code into a package directory named scale_api_compose_pilot (use underscores).
Ensure this directory contains an init.py file.
Separate core logic (e.g., API interactions, Compose handling) into modules like core.py, api.py, etc. inside the package directory.
Place CLI-specific entry code in scale_api_compose_pilot/cli.py.
Create a tests/ directory at the top level for all unit and integration tests.
Place any utility or helper scripts in a scripts/ directory if needed.
Ensure there is a .gitignore file at the root for Python and editor artifacts.
2. Apply Naming Conventions

All Python files and directories: use lowercase_with_underscores.py.
All class names: use CamelCase.
All function and variable names: use snake_case.
Ensure all files and folders have descriptive, concise names.
3. Make the Project Installable as a Python Library

Add a pyproject.toml file at the root with project metadata, dependencies, and build system (setuptools recommended).
In pyproject.toml, configure an entry point for the CLI:
Example:
TOML
[project.scripts]
scale-api-compose-pilot = "scale_api_compose_pilot.cli:main"
Add a README.md with installation and usage instructions for both the CLI and import as a library.
Add a LICENSE file.
Ensure all dependencies are listed in pyproject.toml.
4. Write or Refactor CLI Code

In scale_api_compose_pilot/cli.py, implement a main() function that provides the command-line interface.
Ensure CLI code imports and uses the core logic from other modules.
Use argparse, click, or typer for argument parsing and help messages.
Ensure the CLI can be run as:
Code
scale-api-compose-pilot --help
5. Add or Refactor Tests

In tests/, add or update test files to cover core functionality and CLI.
Use pytest as the test runner if not already used.
6. Prepare for PyPI Publication

Ensure pyproject.toml has all required metadata (name, version, description, author, license, dependencies).
Ensure the package builds successfully with:
Code
python -m build
Ensure the CLI works after installing with pip.
7. Homebrew Formula Preparation

After publishing the package to PyPI, create a Homebrew formula (Ruby file) that:
Downloads the PyPI tarball.
Uses Python virtualenv to install dependencies.
Installs the CLI script.
Includes a test block that runs scale-api-compose-pilot --help.
Put the formula in a tap repository or submit to homebrew-core if appropriate.
8. Documentation

Update README.md to include:
Installation via pip (PyPI).
Installation via Homebrew.
Basic usage for both CLI and Python import.
Example commands.
9. Final Checklist

All code is importable as a library and usable as a CLI.
File and directory names follow Python conventions.
Tests pass.
The project installs and runs as expected via pip and Homebrew.
Deliverables:

Refactored directory & file structure
pyproject.toml
CLI entry point
Tests in tests/
Homebrew formula file
Updated README.md and LICENSE
